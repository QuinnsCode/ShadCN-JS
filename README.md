I have had to go through this a couple times stripping out the Typescript to make ShadCN components work in my RedwoodJS project.

I followed the Redwood forum post here:
https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/cant-figure-out-how-to-install-shadcn-cli/7087/3

Into Amy's ShadCN setup guide, but I am using JS in a lot of my projects still so I had to strip out the TS code (prop types, interfaces and <types>)

I then followed the PR instructions (soon to be added to RedwoodJS docs) here:
https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pull/10459
As well as her video demo of the process here:

Hopefully this makes it a little easier for JS people to also use these awesome components!

Note: I did not do the Data Table or Table elements as that will also need TanStack Table and will be a little more installing and setup needed.
